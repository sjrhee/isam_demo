II.     Informix Error Messages

        Two new error messages are introduced in this release.

        ERROR   DESCRIPTION
        =====   ===========
        -21501  ISAM error:  Record Overflow : Unable to Insert a Row.
                SE/C-ISAM was unable to insert a row because the file
                already contains  2^31 -1 (2147483647) rows.
                You have reached the maximum number of rows for this
                file.  Delete some rows before you add more rows.

        -21502  ISAM error:  Incompatible log file format.
                The transaction log file format is incompatible with
                the SE/C-ISAM version being used.  This could be
                because the transaction log file was created using
                an older version of SE/C-ISAM.
                Ensure that the transaction log file is used by the 
                same version of SE/C-ISAM that created it, so that
                the log file format is compatible.
