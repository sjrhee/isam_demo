II.   UNIX Products Installation Guide

      A. Using 7.2+ relay module with a 5.x client

         For 7.2+ products, the message files have been moved from
         the $INFORMIXDIR/msg to subdirectories within $INFORMIXDIR/msg.  

         To use the 7.2+ relay module with a 5.x client,
         the 7.2+ product needs to be installed in the same 
         INFORMIXDIR directory as the 5.x product.

         If for some reason the 7.2+ product cannot be installed in 
         the 5.x product directory, manually copy or create a symbolic link 
         of the subdirectories from the 7.2+ $INFORMIXDIR/msg/ directory
         to the 5.x $INFORMIXDIR/msg/ directory. 

      B. Role-Separation Installation Script

         Informix automatically sets the user logins of 
         DBSSO and AAO to informix. No prompt is displayed.
