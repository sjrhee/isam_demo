I.    Overview of IBM Informix C-ISAM Programmer's Manual

C-ISAM is an indexed sequential access method that IBM Informix
has defined and implemented in the C language. This file 
describes the 7.20 C-ISAM Programmer's Manual and its known 
errata.  It also identifies feature and performance topics 
that are not covered in the manual, or for which the behavior 
of this version of C-ISAM differs from descriptions in the 
manual.  This file contains vital information on C-ISAM 
application and performance issues.
 
See also the Release Notes that are provided with C-ISAM 7.26.

        ====================================
 
II.  Documentation Notes and Errata
 
The C-ISAM Programmer's Manual describes how to use C-ISAM, 
how to define and use indexes and B+ trees, data types,
locking, transaction management, and additional facilities.  
Programming examples and individual descriptions of all of 
the C-ISAM library functions for file manipulation, format 
conversion, and format manipulation are also provided.
Appendices describe the bcheck utility, Global Language
Support (GLS), error codes, file formats, selected topics 
in system administration, and header files.


New Upper Limits on File Size for This Release
----------------------------------------------
"New Features of This Product" on page 6 of the Introduction 
describes features that were new to Version 7.20 of C-ISAM.  
Version 7.26 has increased theoretical limits on file sizes.
(Your actual limits might be lower, if your platform cannot
read large files, or is constrained by available hardware.)

In the following table, values are in bytes, and "PREVIOUS
LIMIT" refers to C-ISAM Version 7.24 and earlier.  As a 
comparison, the term "gigabyte" usually denotes 2^30 bytes.

TYPE OF C-ISAM FILE            7.26 LIMIT    PREVIOUS LIMIT
===================            ==========    ==============
Fixed-Length Records
  Maximum data file size:      (2^40) - 1     (2^31) - 1
  Maximum index file size:     (2^40) - 1     (2^31) - 1

Variable-Length Records
  Maximum data file size:      (2^40) - 1     (2^31) - 1
  Maximum index file size:     (2^34) - 1     (2^31) - 1

Maximum transaction file size: (2^63) - 1     (2^31) - 1
Maximum audit trail file size: (2^63) - 1     (2^31) - 1
 
Here the maximum data and index file sizes for fixed-length 
and variable-length records are based on a NODESIZE of 512 
bytes. These values double for a 1024 byte NODESIZE.

Values in the "7.26 LIMIT" column above are for 64-bit 
platforms, and for 32-bit platforms that can use special 
APIs that the Machine Notes file describes.  On 32-bit 
platforms that do not support special APIs for accessing 
large files, the "PREVIOUS LIMIT" values continue to apply.


The bcheck Utility
------------------
The diagram on page 11 of the Introduction, illustrating 
notational conventions of syntax diagrams, contains an error.  
The "V" term near the bottom of the diagram should not be 
in italic font, because it is a literal, not a variable. 
(For the correct syntax of bcheck, see page A-2.)

The use of versions of the bcheck utility (and of the dblog
utility) that were provided with C-ISAM Version 7.24 or 
earlier is not supported for files created by this release.  
Similarly, the use of versions of bcheck or dblog that were
provided with INFORMIX-SE Version 7.24 or earlier is not
supported for files created with this release of C-ISAM.


The isflush() Function
----------------------
If the argument of isflush() is the descriptor of a file that was 
opened in ISINPUT mode, error -101 ("ENOTOPEN") is returned.  
Use isflush() only with files that isopen() or isbuild() opened 
in ISOUTPUT or ISINOUT mode.  

The description of error -101 on page C-5 states:

   "An attempt was made to perform some operation on a C-ISAM 
    file that was not previously opened using the isopen call," 

This neglects the fact that the wrong access mode in an 
otherwise successful isopen() call can elicit this error.


The islogopen() Function
------------------------
If the argument of islogopen() points to a file that is not
empty, but whose format does not match what the section "New 
Transaction Log File Format" describes later in this document, 
then C-ISAM issues error -21502, and no file is opened.  You 
cannot use this version of C-ISAM with transaction log files 
that were created by Version 7.24 (or earlier) of C-ISAM.
 

The isindexinfo(), isdictinfo(), and iskeyinfo() Functions
----------------------------------------------------------
Page 8-35 shows the prototype of isindexinfo() as:

  int    isindexinfo(isfd, buffer, number)
         int isfd;
         struct keydesc *buffer;
         int number; 

Here the second argument ("buffer") depends on the third 
argument: ("number") in the following way:

 o  The "buffer" argument should be a pointer to a "keydesc" 
    structure if the third argument is greater than zero.  

 o  The "buffer" argument should be a pointer to a "dictinfo"
    structure if the third argument is zero.  

The third argument must never be negative.  Any other type 
for the the second argument is an error, but neither the C 
compiler nor the C-ISAM library can detect this.  

If "number" has zero as its value, the "buffer" argument can 
also be a pointer to a "dictinfo" structure, but in this case, 
a compilation error from a prototype mismatch can result.

In this release, this issue has been resolved as follows:

 o To maintain compatibility with existing C-ISAM applications,
   the prototype of isindexinfo() has been changed to this:

    int    isindexinfo(int isfd, void *buffer, int number);

 o Two new file manipulation functions have been provided with 
   the following prototypes in the isam.h file:

    int    isdictinfo(int isfd, struct dictinfo *buffer);
    int    iskeyinfo(int isfd, struct keydesc *buffer, int number);

 o Function isindexinfo() internally calls isdictinfo() if the
   value of "number" is zero;  it calls iskeyinfo() if the value 
   of "number" is greater than zero.  

Version 7.26 applications can call isdictinfo() and iskeyinfo() 
directly.  In new C-ISAM applications, use the new isdictinfo() 
and iskeyinfo() functions, rather than isindexinfo(), which 
C-ISAM retains only for backwards compatability with legacy
applications and compliance with X/Open Group XPG3 standards.
(The subsequent XPG4 standard supersedes XPG3, but does not
standardize the indexed sequential access method.)


The isrelease() Function
------------------------
After releasing all locks on records, as described on 
page 8-51, isrelease() also unlocks the open file 
descriptor that its argument specifies.


The lddblnull() and ldfltnull() Functions
-----------------------------------------
The functions lddblnull(), as described on page 8-73, and 
ldfltnull(), as described on page 8-77, do not behave correctly 
unless the isam/isam.h header file is included. (This is
because these two functions can be implemented as macros.)

The prototype for ldfltnull() has changed from previous release.
The legacy prototype was :
double ldfltnull(char *location, short *nullflag);
This has been changed to :
float ldfltnull(char *location, short *nullflag);


The stchar() Function Prototype
------------------------------- 
On page 8-80, the semicolon (;) terminator appears erroneously at
the end of the first line of the stchar() function prototype:

     void stchar(cstr,fstr,length);

This is a typographic error. Delete the semicolon.
       

New Error Messages
------------------
Appendix C does not include two error messages that are present
in the  Version 7.26 of C-ISAM.

 ERROR      DESCRIPTION AND POSSIBLE CAUSE
=======    ================================
 -26061    ISAM error: Cannot write. Maximum node number has been reached.

 -26062    ISAM error: Cannot write. Btree limit has been reached.


These errors are defined in the isam.h file:

           #define ENODEFULL     26061
           #define ETREEFULL     26062

(These new error codes are outside the numeric range of other
ISAM and RSAM errors because no more unassigned numbers are
available within the traditional range.)



New Transaction Log File Format
-------------------------------
Pages D-9 and following of "C-ISAM Programmer's Manual"
describe the transaction log file format for C-ISAM 7.24 
and earlier versions. Version 7.26 contains several 
changes to the legacy format of transaction log files.

o  A "magic number" now begins each transaction log file.
   C-ISAM uses this number to recognize a valid transaction 
   log.  This prevents this version of C-ISAM from writing
   in a transaction log that had also been written by an 
   earlier version. (If a log file included records in 
   both the old and new formats, it could not be read by 
   any C-ISAM version, and would be useless for purposes 
   of recovery.)

o  The LG_XID transaction ID is increased to 4 bytes
   (from 2 bytes in Version 7.24 and earlier releases).  

o  The LG_PREV offset of the previous log record is now
   increased to 8 bytes (from 4 bytes in earlier versions).
   This supports log files larger than 2^31 - 1 bytes
   for 64-bit platforms and for some 32-bit platforms.

o  The LG_PREVLEN offset of the previous log length is
   now defined as:
                    LG_PREV+sizeof(IFMX_OFF_T)

   Here the value of the right-hand addend is platform-
   dependent:

   o  It is 8 bytes on 64-bit platforms or 32-bit 
      platforms that can read large files.

   o  It is 4 bytes on 32-bit platforms that cannot
      read files larger than 2^31 - 1 bytes.

The transaction file format in Appendix D is difficult to 
read, because the text does not display some whitespace 
that separates tokens within lines.  The following code,
however, shows the new format for this C-ISAM release:

--------------------------------------------------------

Because of file format differences between this release
and Version 7.24 (and earlier), this release of C-ISAM
cannot read transaction log files that were written in 
the old format, and older C-ISAM releases cannot read 
logs in the new format.  

Be careful to follow the Release Notes instructions 
concerning transaction logs (and other files) when you 
migrate from an older version to this release, or if 
you need to revert to an older version.


Localized Indexes
-----------------
Page E-5 asserts that the CLIENT_LOCALE environment 
variable should be set to the value that LC_COLLATE 
specified when a localized index was built.  But the
current GLS library no longer supports LC_COLLATE.

You must set the CLIENT_LOCALE to the locale that was 
used when the localized index was created.  If some
collation other than the codeset order of this locale
is required, you must specify it in the COLLATION 
category of the locale file that CLIENT_LOCALE specifies.
(See Appendix A of "Informix Guide to GLS Functionality"
for more information about the COLLATION category.


No other problems are known to exist with this manual.
